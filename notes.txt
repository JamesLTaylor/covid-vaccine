agents move - simulates coming in contact with different people
there is a prob of infecting another person if distance is less than R_c

agent states
  S: susceptible
  I: infected severe
  F: free - infected mild/none
  E: exposed - infected not yet known
  V: dead
  vaccinated
  R: recovered

different agents have different risk of death
agents exist in regions of different density
Some move further which simulates more connected people
Agents should be mean reverting


Different initial clustering? How to do that?
  Maybe simulate K means then simulate data around the means


Known
  Age distribution
  death profile per age
  Target R0 of 2.5 is susceptible population
  proportion with no symptoms
  time from infection to symptoms



Calibration
  Number of clusters
  variation in cluster
  R_c to create infection
  distribution of social speed
  mean reversion


SA Target
  known initial growth rate and saturation time
  time of second wave


Simulation
  Place agents
  Give agents a speed and an age
  start moving and infecting

  Check number infected and deaths at each epoch
  plot points

Speed: Mioght be better to break the space into cells rather than Rc. Then we do not need to check all pairs
just see if anyone else is in the same cell.


*Notes on Paper*

We don't have the same city size distribution as Germany
The death rate seems constant
